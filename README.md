#Radius Raid#

Radius Raid is a space themed shoot 'em up where you must blast away unrelenting enemies before they destroy you. Features 13 enemy types, 5 powerups, retro sound effects, and locally stored stats.

This is an an entry for [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) 2013. The theme this year was bad luck, but I didn't work it into my game at all. There are certainly luck and chance factors that affect the gameplay, but those weren't built in for the competition.
